* Most (all) evaluation stuff hasn't been tweaked

Don't waste the best move of uncompleted searches

Test counter move heuristic, results seem to be extremely small (maybe the implementation is incorrect?)

Assert function for debugging

better move ordering:

- if not a capture, score higher based on how much it improves piece square table evaluation (maybe only for knights/bishops/rooks/queens)

- 

castling strategy:

- penalty for king not being on safe square without castling (completed)
- penalty for rook blocked by uncastled king
- 

king safety:

- virtual queen mobility on king square (completed)
- pawn shield (completed)
- pawn storm

pawn structure:

- connected pawns (for each pawn check if another pawn defends it)
